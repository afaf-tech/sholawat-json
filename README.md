# Sholawat JSON

All praise is due to Allah SWT for His countless blessings. May blessings and peace always be upon our beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW.

**sholawat-json** is a collection of sholawat in a simple JSON format, aimed at developers who wish to integrate them into websites or applications. Each JSON file represents a different sholawat and follows a predefined schema, ensuring ease of access and consistent structure. To maintain accuracy and structure, we implement `JSON schema` validation, making it easier to integrate the data confidently. This project is designed for lightweight applications, with a focus on speed and efficiency, and includes Go files for testing schema compliance.

We strive for accuracy, but if you encounter any errors, please reach out. Your feedback is invaluable for improvement.

## Data Sources

The sholawat data in this project has been collected from various trusted sources, including reputable Islamic literature and applications. Each data entry has gone through a multi-stage validation process to ensure accuracy and authenticity.
